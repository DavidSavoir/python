"""The output should be about the same as what's shown depending on how you deal with the "&".
Your wordlist contains "'Men," suggesting punctuation cleaning is not thorough.

An example of punctuation cleaning from the Lessons was more like:

for symbol in string.punctuation:
    target = target.replace(symbol, "")

Splitting with no argument is a far better strategy than splitting on " "
because .split( ) consumes all whitespace, including newlines.

I would suggest going straight to words from the passage like this:

words = f.read().split()

and then:

for word in words:

but instead of len(word) you could have a function that strips out any punctuation there
and then:

for word in words:
   true_length = get_length(word)  # function to NOT count puctuation as part of length
   t_dict[true_length] = t_dict.get(true_length, 0) + 1  # something like this

Just an idea.  Your numbers are quite a bit different than those shown."""
